Hi, I am *Adithya Selvaprithiviraj*, currently a Software Engineer at Microsoft. I love thinking about *Life*, *Universe* and *Computer programs*.

 I strongly believe in the *philosophy of learning by doing* and have worked on several [projects](/projects) in fields of Cloud Computing, Distributed Systems, Programming language theory, Computer Vision, Embedded systems, Robotics and Internet Of Things. I am a foodie and I love trying different food. In my free time, I write code which helps me to automate humdrum tasks.
