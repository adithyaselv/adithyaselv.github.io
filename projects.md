## **AgriConnect**

#### Project Description

  * Monitoring huge farms and irrigating the crops has always been very challenging, involving lot of Manual labour and Cost associated to it.
  * So we developed a highly low cost IOT solution by designing our own sensor node hardware, which can be deployed in several spots in the field to monitor. Also we developed a master controller which can communicate with these nodes and get sensor data as well as control the irrigation.

<br />

* Facial landmarks were detected using dlib library and feature set was extracted from several face datasets.
* Training was done with the obtained feature set using several supervised learning models and their performances were analysed.
* An application was developed to identify the face expression of the person in an image using the trained model.

<br />

#### Project Description

  * Machines have started to replace manpower in every sector. The major draw back with them is the need for monitoring and controlling by humans. The machine health and performance is also often neglected leading to disruption in production line resulting in downtime.
  * We proposed to use a centralized system to control monitor a group of machines by a single operator. It also collects important parameters to predict the machine health and defective parts.

*Won us 3rd place at IndiaHacks Hackathon by HackerEarth*

<br />

* Developed a soft microprocessor starting from a simple NAND gate with the help Xilinx system generator toolbox using matlab and implemented the design on Spartan 3E FPGA.
* Developed all the necessary sub-modules for programming and debugging the soft processor such as, the assembler, VGA interface driver, PS2 Keyboard interface driver.

* Implemented Localization and Pose estimation based on arbitrary defined color contours detection using
OpenCV C++ library.
* Implemented A* based search on the image to find the optimal path through a obstacle maze.
* Implemented a PID based control system based on the kinematics of the differential driving system.
